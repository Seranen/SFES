# SFES

File encryption and decryption app. Code with GUI which allow you to encrypt and decrypt your file with key.

Currently only supports AES algorithm, but with time I will add another encryption algorithm

It has different types of block mode: [CBS, CBF, OFB].

To use this code you need just install all requirements, and run that code. All other things for work with this you'll find in GUI
